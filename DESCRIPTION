Description: The classical Bass (1969) <doi:10.1287/mnsc.15.5.215> model and the agent based models, such as that by Goldenberg, Libai and Muller (2010) <doi:10.1016/j.ijresmar.2009.06.006> have been two different approaches to model adoption processes in marketing. These two approaches can be unified by explicitly modelling the utility functions. This package provides a GUI that allows, in a unified way, the modelling of these two processes and other processes.
